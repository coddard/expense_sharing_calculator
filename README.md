# expense_sharing_calculator
The Expense Sharing Calculator is a Python script designed to fairly split shared expenses among a group of people. It allows users to input the total amount each person has paid, calculates individual balances, and generates an optimized payment plan to settle debts with transfers between as few people as possible.
